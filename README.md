# LimelightTests
Computer Vision testing with limelight

We use our [Tecbot Resources](https://github.com/Tecbot3158/TecbotResources) library
to set up motors and OI, etc.

We then connect to the Limelight (version 2+) through the Network Tables, 
and print values to the SmartDashboard (inside Shuffleboard).

Goal: Set up a target and make the robot center itself automatically.

Bonus: Make it get closer or farther depending on how far the robot is
from the target.
